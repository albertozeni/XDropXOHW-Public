Brief description of project: 

Pairwise sequence alignment is one of the most computationally intensive kernels in genomic data analysis, accounting for more than 90% of the run time for key bioinformatics applications. This method is particularly expensive for third-generation sequences due to the high computational expense of analyzing these long read lengths (1Kb-1Mb). Given the quadratic overhead of exact pairwise algorithms such as Smith-Waterman, for long alignments the community primarily relies on approximate algorithms that search only for high-quality alignments and stop early when one is not found. In this work, we present the first FPGA implementation of the popular X-drop alignment algorithm, named PALADIN.
